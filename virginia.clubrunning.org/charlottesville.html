			<p class="accompanies-top-line">
				The Rivanna Trails, named for the river they follow, are a series of trails which form a giant circle
				around most of Charlottesville. Well maintained with many relatively flat stretches, they provide some
				of the best local running, and are a staple for the team. Easy spots to get on the trail include behind
				Observatory Hill, The Park at North Grounds, and along Barracks Road.

			<h3 class="top-line">Riverview</h3>
			<p class="accompanies-top-line">
				Riverview is a paved stretch of the Rivanna Trail which begins at Riverview Park and follows the path of
				the Rivanna River for ~2.5 miles. The flattest place to run in Charlottesville, Riverview is ideal for
				anything from easy recovery runs to a hard tempo. The path can be accessed by following East
				Market Street from downtown Charlottesville or at Free Bridge (where US-250 crosses the Rivanna River).

			<p class="accompanies-top-line">
				Dick Woods. The famous Dick Woods. There is simply nowhere like it on Earth. The perfect place for a
				long run, it is a team favorite for Sunday mornings. An out-and-back which has no known end, it is a
				beautiful road including woods, farms, hills, and a spectacular view of the Blue Ridge mountains. It is
				about a 25 minute drive from UVA, and is more than worth it, guaranteed.

			<h3 class="top-line">Foxhaven</h3>
			<p class="accompanies-top-line">
				Foxhaven (also known as Bellair) is a neighborhood on Canterbury Road off Ivy Road. A 2.25 mile loop,
				Foxhaven is a great workout location which can accommodate anything from a short interval workout to a
				longer tempo run. Foxhaven also connects to Reservoir via Foxhaven Farm Road, forming a larger loop with
				Alderman Road of about 6 miles.

			<h3 class="top-line">Reservoir</h3>
			<p class="accompanies-top-line">
				Reservoir is a great place for a moderate run or a workout. With big hills and known 1000 and 1600 meter
				marks, the team often comes here for interval workouts. This out-and-back road is located roughly 2.5
				miles from Nameless Field off Fontaine Avenue on Reservoir Road.

				Open to the public as of August 2012, the track at Lannigan Field is one the newest and nicest
				you&rsquo;ll run on. Not only does it offer a high quality and recently resurfaced red track, but it
				also has a soft surface loop made of field turf around the outside of the stands. Find the track's 
				open hours on <a href="https://virginiasports.com/lannigan-field/">their website</a>.
